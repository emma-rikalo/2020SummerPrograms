// This program will calculate the total cost of a meal using user-given input

//                         PSEUDOCODE:
// Declare the double mealCost, and the integers tipPercent and taxPercent
// Create a scanner
// Print prompts for each piece of data needed
// Follow each prompt with the initialization of the corresponding variable according to the input given
// Create the static void solve, and import the variables declared in step 1
// Declare double tip and set it equal to mealCost*(tipPercent/100)
// Declare double tax and set it equal to mealCost*(taxPercent/100)
// Declare double totalCost and set it equal to mealCost + tip + tax
// Print “Your total is: $” + the rounded version of totalCost
