//this version went back to our original plan of using 3 arrays

Pseudocode:
Import Java.util.*
Import Java.io.*
Import Java.nio*
Create an overarching do while loop so that the game is replayable
Create println(“*********”)
Create println(“*WELCOME*”)
Create println(“*********”)
Create a scanner to receive user input
Ask whether the user wants to input, int, double, or strings
Create a new file and set it equal to the file that contains the answers
Create a new scanner to read through that file
Consume all the tokens, and sort them into 3 strings depending on var type
Call the corresponding method that will search for the user’s input in the string that contains the var they’re playing, and give the user points
Create method int
do
Create new scanner
Call string allIntegers (equal to all words in the file)
Declare a new empty string alreadyAnswered
Declare a new int Score
Ask user to input a number & give them the theme
Declare string answer = to user input
If (allIntegers.contains(“answer”) && alreadyAnswered.!contians(“answer”)
Set allIntegers = allIntegers.replace(
Then add answer to alreadyAnswered and add 1 to score
Ask if player wants to enter another int
While (answer =yes)
Return Score
Create methods double/string along the same lines w/ changes according to the different types of var.
While
Use scanner to ask user if they would like to play again
